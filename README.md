# DroneCVzoneContest
Repository made for the CVzone, thank you for the opportunity

Due to some problems with git lfs I could not submit the following files:

on the weights folder ->

                         yolov3.weights
  
                         yolov3.tf.data-00000-of-00001
  
on the data/video folder (just the video I submitted on youtube) ->

                         Results.avi

Here is the link to the google drive folder:

Sorry for the inconvenience, meanwhile I will try to submit them in the repository.
